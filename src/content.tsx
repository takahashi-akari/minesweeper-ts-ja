              Click on a square to reveal what is underneath. If you click on a
              mine, you lose. If you click on a number, it will tell you how
              many mines are in the surrounding squares. Use this information to
              deduce which squares are safe to click. If you click on a square
              with no surrounding mines, all surrounding squares will
              automatically be revealed. If you reveal all squares that are not
              mines, you win!
